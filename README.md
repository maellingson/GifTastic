I was able to console log the cartoon name, the query URL, and the object returned from both the button push and the search field.

I ran into trouble creating a new div to hold the image. I spent a lot of time trying to figure this out, and am not sure where I'm going wrong. 

I also included code to click on the image to animate and make still, but wasn't able to generate an image to work with due to the div problem and I don't know if it works.
